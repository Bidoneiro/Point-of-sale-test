This program represents an imitation of a selling point. As input we have barcodes. 
When the proper code is "scanned" we will receive answer with information about product
and purchase it if it is available.
Currently barcodes included ine the database are 11111,22222,33333,44444,55555. 
They are set in the file "product database.txt". 
You can add products by yourself following the formula:
Barcode:
Name of the product:
Number of available product:
Price:
and also by changing the variable sizeOfList in the class ProductDatabase.
To exit the program you need to write "exit" instead of barcode.
